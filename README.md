## Description

KnowNative is inspired by two of my core philosophies of language learning: 

* Our learning is most sustainable when we are genuinely interested in the content we are using to study.
* The more we learn from real native speakers during the learning process, the easier it is to develop natural fluency in a target language.

KnowNative is designed to move learners away from dry textbook material into the world of real language by providing them a means to easily study from content produced by native speakers.
