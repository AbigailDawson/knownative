As the creator of KnowNative, I am eager to collaborate with others who are excited about this project and are looking to contribute to on a more regular and consistent (volunteer) basis. We currently have a small team of Core Contributors who are innovating behind the scenes to bring high quality features and exceptional user experience to KnowNative. Read more here: <a href="#">Core Contributors</a>.

Becoming a Core Contributor is an excellent way to gain real-world experience working with a team and add to your own portfolio or resume, all while being a part of a project you're passionate about! I'm currently open to Core Contributors with skills in:

- UX/UI research and design
- Software development
- Branding, social media and marketing
- Those with a special interest in linguistics and language learning - if you'd like to contribute, I'd love to hear from you!

Core Contributors benefit from the following:

- Special recognition on our website, with your image, bio and professional/social links
- Experience working solo or in small groups
- Weekly group coding sessions

To be considered a Core Contributor of the KnowNative project, developers must commit to submitting one meaningful PR per month and attend at least one team meeting or 1:1 check-in per month. Participation is voluntary, and these requirements are in place to ensure harmonious collaboration among team members who are serious about the project. There is no minimum commitment for hours/week or number of months, and all experience levels are welcome.
